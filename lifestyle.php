					<h3>Dining</h3>
					<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-8 lifestyleDining">
					<p>
						Every O’Neill Healthcare location has an on-site kitchen, where our trained dietary staff prepares each day’s meals. We use fresh ingredients and prepare homemade dishes aimed to please the most finicky eaters. Licensed dietitians review all menus, assuring that the nutritional content and compliance with special dietary regimens is met or surpassed.
					</p>
					<p>
						Skilled Nursing and Assisted Living residents receive three meals every day of the week, and nutritious snacks are available between meals and in the evenings.  Independent Living residents have the option of eating meals in our Assisted Living dining rooms, choosing the days and meals to fit their schedule.
					</p>
					<p>
						All residents choose their specific meals from a nutritionally balanced menu, changed frequently to afford variety and incorporate comfort foods that make each meal a pleasure. 
					</p>

					<div class="lifestyleDining">
						<p>
							Each O’Neill Healthcare location has multiple dining rooms, which are tastefully decorated, airy rooms where all meals are individually plated and served tableside.  Residents are encouraged to enjoy their meals in these social, inviting settings, but the dietary staff is understanding and flexible. Late risers can take advantage of breakfast-in-bed, or a room service meal can be ordered. 
						</p>
					</div>
					<br>
					<h4>Holidays</h4>
					<p>
						<strong>Holidays</strong> are special times – and it is no different at O’Neill Healthcare. Fourth of July, Labor Day and other summer holidays are celebrated with cookouts and picnic foods. Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners are complete with roasted turkey, stuffing, fresh pies and all the trimmings. Each season has something to celebrate, and our kitchens create seasonal treats that are favorites of our residents.
					</p>
					<h4>Guests</h4>
					<p>
						<strong>Guests</strong> are welcome to join their loved one for a meal – just contact the facility’s Front Office for more information. Private dining rooms are available in each facility, where families and groups can enjoy a meal, party or special event with a loved one.
					</p>
					<h4>A Food Committee</h4>
					<p>
						<strong>A Food Committee</strong> meets at each location regularly. Residents are encouraged to attend and participate, so that menu satisfaction, recipe feedback, and suggestions can be gathered and reflected in the ongoing meal plans.
					</p>
					

					<h3>Activities & Social Events</h3>
					<p>
						At O’Neill Healthcare, we work to promote a healthy and active lifestyle for each and every resident. Social interaction and mental stimulation are known to promote physical, cognitive and emotional well-being, and residents in our communities have many options and outlets in which they are encouraged to participate.
					</p>
					<p>
						Every location offers social lounges, television or theater viewing rooms, and libraries or bistros where residents can relax in comfort and enjoy the company of the activities staff, volunteers, family or other residents. In these casual, unstructured gathering places, it is easy to work side-by-side on a jigsaw puzzle, discuss the day’s current events, or join the laughter during a comedy show.

					</p>
					<p>
						There are numerous events planned each month, both on-site and as outings to locale venues, and are designed for the varied cognitive and physical ability levels of our residents.
					</p>
					<p>
						A Resident Activity Committee meets at every O’Neill Healthcare location, and participants suggest events, plan activities or form new clubs, so the variety of recreational programming stays interesting.
					</p>
					<p>
